This repository contains a clean, professional portfolio template for an industrial designer with **three projects**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork or clone** this repository.
2. Rename the repo following the pattern `<username>.github.io` to enable GitHub Pages, or enable Pages under **Settings → Pages**.
3. Update the following files with your own content:
   - `index.html` – Replace placeholder text, project descriptions, images, and social links.
   - `assets/css/style.css` – Adjust colors, fonts, or layout as desired.
   - `assets/js/main.js` – Extend JavaScript if you need additional interactivity.
4. Commit your changes and push to `main`. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/`.

## ✍️ Customization Tips

- **Project Images**: Replace image URLs with your own photos or upload images to `assets/img/` and update the `src` paths.
- **Branding**: Change color variables in `style.css` (`--clr-primary`, `--clr-secondary`, etc.) to match your brand.
